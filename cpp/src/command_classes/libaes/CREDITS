All the original code for AES came from Brian Gladman, who has also
been *very* helpful and responsive to my emails.  See
	http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptography_technology/rijndael/

I found a modified version of Brian's code with Jari Ruusu's name in
the comments.  I don't have any contact information for Jari, and
actually his code has pretty much vanished now...

The perlasm code was taken directly from the OpenSSL project.

The rest of this, almost certainly including all the mistakes, was
written by me, Nigel Metheringham, with support from my employer.
