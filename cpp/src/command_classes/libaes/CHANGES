The original C and assembly code used within this library were taken
from Brian Gladman's web pages on 9 Jan 2002.  
Brian's original disclaimer and license information is included in all
files derived from his work, as well as in the README file.

The following changes were made to the original code:-
  - #define renames:-
     BLOCK_SIZE -> AES_BLOCK_SIZE
     TYPE_PREFIX -> AES_TYPE_PREFIX
     NAME_PREFIX -> AES_NAME_PREFIX
     DUAL_KEY_SCHEDULE -> AES_DUAL_KEY_SCHEDULE
     ENCRYPT_ONLY -> AES_ENCRYPT_ONLY
     DECRYPT_ONLY -> AES_DECRYPT_ONLY
     KS_LENGTH -> AES_KS_LENGTH
     RC_LENGTH -> AES_RC_LENGTH

  - routine name changes (added c_name() macro)
     convert_key 

  - declarations that are not needed to *use* libaes have
    been migrated out of aes.h -> aes_options.h
    Also sets of the code from aes.c also migrated into
    aes_options.h to facilitate splitting of code for
    encrypt/decrypt, set_key, set_blk and tables into
    separate C files.  [This is done to allow the easy
    replacement of (say) the encrypt/decrypt functions
    with an assembler equivalent.
